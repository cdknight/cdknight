# Hi, I'm Ramesh!

I do programming things sometimes. Sometimes I don't.

Until some more things magically appear here, check out [ramesh.tv](https://ramesh.tv), which also has my [blog](https://blog.ramesh.tv) that I update infrequently with random things.

**An interesting function:** sqrt(x)sin(0.5Ï€x). It's very interpretable (to me)!
